*NOTE*: This package is *heavily* a work in progress.

* Overview

  This package implements a [[https://github.com/magit/transient][transient command]] for running commands on a Bazel
  workspace. It is heavily inspired by the use of transient commands in [[https://github.com/magit/magit][Magit]].

* Development Notes

  I am prioritizing the *testing* workflow, i.e. =bazel test=, since that is
  what's most pressing to me in my current work at the moment. Currently, the
  following are possible from within the transient:

  - Easily switch between different test output and summary styles;
  - Set test timeout;
  - Set test filter;
  - Select the test target within the workspace to run;
  - Run all tests within the current buffer's package.

  the functionality of this package.

  Thanks to [[https://github.com/tarsius][Jonas Bernoulli]] and the [[https://github.com/magit/magit][Magit]] project for creating the foundation of
  [[https://github.com/magit/transient][Transient]], which forms the core motivation of this project.
